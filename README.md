# Julia Integer Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential integer overflow bug in Julia when dealing with large integer values and the `^` operator (exponentiation). The bug and its solution are presented in separate Julia files (`bug.jl` and `bugSolution.jl`).

## Bug Description

The `bug.jl` file contains a function `myfunction` that squares a given input `x`.  However, if `x` is a large positive integer, the calculation `x^2` can result in integer overflow, leading to an incorrect or unexpected result.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a solution to mitigate the risk of integer overflow.  It uses the `BigInt` type to handle arbitrarily large integers. The solution ensures the result is always correct, even for extremely large input values.
